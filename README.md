# HYRUP - Get Hired For Your Skills, Not Your Degree 🚀

HYRUP is a modern, immersive student career launchpad designed to bridge the gap between traditional education and professional success. Built by students for students, HYRUP prioritizes actual skills and real-world problem-solving over college names.

## 🌌 Features

### 1. **Immersive Cosmic Experience**
- **Dynamic Space Background**: A high-performance starry background that creates an atmospheric browsing experience.
- **Floating Logo Infusion**: Centered, theme-aware branding that floats subtly between the background and content layers.

### 2. **Next-Gen Custom Cursor**
- **Neon Orange Pointer**: A sharp, high-fidelity arrow pointer with a vibrant neon orange glow.
- **White Meteor Trail**: A realistic, physics-based meteor streak that follows the cursor, adding a sense of speed and fluidity.
- **Theme-Aware Physics**: The cursor automatically adapts its fill and border colors based on the current Light/Dark mode for maximum visibility.

### 3. **Fix Forward Challenge**
- A dedicated platform section where students can register for the "Fix Forward" initiative, focusing on solving actual industry problems rather than academic exercises.

### 4. **Modern UI/UX**
- **Accessible Typography**: Ultra-refined font scaling and high-contrast color palettes specifically tuned for mobile readability and desktop spatiality.
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by **GSAP** and **Framer Motion** for silky-smooth transitions and micro-interactions.
